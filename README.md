## _**1**_ - _ASK_ 
### 1.1 Business task
To analyze consumer usage of smart devices with existing competitors and gain useful insights to identify potential growth opportunities in the global market with high-level recommendations for Bella beat’s marketing strategy. 

### 1.2 Key stakeholders
1.	**Urška Sršen** — Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
2.	**Sando Mur** — Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key   member of the Bellabeat executive team
3.	**Bellabeat marketing analytics team** — A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that  helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

## _**2**_ - _PREPARE_
The dataset used for analysis is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius/ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset is available on ‘Kaggle’ platform and contains personal fitness tracker details from thirty Fitbit users

### 2.1 Dataset description

1. The dataset includes information about physical activity, steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring ranging from minute-level to daily output of the **31** Fitbit users.
2 The data consists of **18** datasets and the data table is organized in a long format. 
3. These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between April 2016 to May 2016.
4. The data is available through CC0: Public Domain which means the data is Copywrite free and can be modified, or copied without seeking any permission from the author. 

### 2.2 Checking credibility and integrity of dataset, ROCCC analysis is performed as follows : -

### ROCCC approach
**Reliable**: The data is from consented 30 Fitbit users, while data might be reliable, sample bias might occur due to gender not being specified in the dataset. 

**Original**: The dataset is not original as it was originally collected from Amazon Mechanical Murk (2nd-Party Data collection).

**Comprehensive**: The dataset consists of daily activities, calories used, sleep time, steps, and weight records. However, the sample size is small and does not include age, gender and other parameters to represent the population as a whole. 

**Current**: The Data was collected in 2016 thus, it does not necessarily provide recent consumer usage habits.

**Cited**: The data collected is well documented.

### 2.3 Data Selection
We require daily usage patterns of smart devices to discover important insights and trends within the Fitbit data. Therefore, the dataset can be selected as follows; -
1. **dailyActivity_merged.csv**
2. **dailyIntensities_merged.csv**
3. **dailyCalories_merged.csv**
4. **dailySteps_merged.csv**
5. **weightLogInfo_merged.csv**  
6. **sleepDay_merged.csv**

## _**3**_ - _PROCESS_
To perform required SQL queries and handle the data ‘Big Query’ is used for this case study. The tool can verify the data for any errors, ensure data integrity, clean the data, and transform the required data for accurate analysis.

### 3.1 Uploading the data
The data can be downloaded from the ‘Kaggle’ platform and uploaded as a CSV file into the ‘MS SQL Server’. The data once uploaded can be previewed to check the data organization, ensuring the correct data type for each field parameter. 

### 3.2 Data cleaning 
**3.2.1  Checking for unique id for each dataset**

dailyActivity_merged ;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
# 33 id's
```
dailyCalories_merged;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM[dbo].[dailyCalories_merged]
# 33 id's
```
dailyIntensities_merged;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM [dbo].[dailyIntensities_merged]
# 33 id's
```
dailySteps_merged;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM [dbo].[dailySteps_merged]
# 33 id's
```
sleepDay_merged;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM [dbo].[sleepDay_merged]
# 24 id's
````
weightLogInfo_merged;-
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]
# 8 id's
````
There are 4 dataset with 33 unique id's whereas, sleepDay_merged has 24 and weightLogInfo_merged has only 8.

**3.3 Checking for common data** 

The datasets have common columns across multiple tables, verifying the similar column can help in streamlining the queries.
Therefore, some parameters such as calories, steps and sedentary time are available in dailyActivity_merged dataset.

To check calories, match up with Activity table
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Calories)
FROM[dbo].[dailyCalories_merged]
#734
```
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Calories)
FROM[dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
#734
```
To check steps, match up with Activity table
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT TotalSteps)
FROM[dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
# 842
```
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT StepTotal)
FROM [dbo].[dailySteps_merged]
# 842
```
To check sedentary time, match up with Activity table
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SedentaryMinutes)
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
# 549
```
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SedentaryMinutes)
FROM [dbo].[dailyIntensities_merged]
#549
```
Upon checking and confirming the parameters for 1) steps(daily_steps), 2) calories(dailyCalories) & 3) sedentary minutes(dailyIntensities) with activity table(dailyActivity). We can verify that dailyActivity table consists of all the following parameters. Hence, dailyActivity table can be used solely for further analysis with respect to the following 3 paramters.

**3.4 Checking for Start-End date and Id.**

Activity date period
```
SELECT MIN(ActivityDate) AS StartDate, 
MAX(ActivityDate) AS EndDate
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]

#StartDate - 2016-04-12
#EndDate - 2016-05-12
```
Sleep date period
```
SELECT MIN(SleepDay) AS StartDate, MAX(SleepDay) AS EndDate
FROM [dbo].[sleepDay_merged]

#StartDate - 2016-04-12
#EndDate - 2016-05-12
```
```
SELECT MIN(Date) AS StartDate, MAX(Date) AS EndDate
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]

#StartDate - 2016-04-12
#EndDate - 2016-05-12
```
To Check ID length for dailyActivity, sleepDay, weightLog
```
SELECT DISTINCT( (LEN(Id))) 
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]

SELECT DISTINCT( (LEN(Id)))
FROM [dbo].[sleepDay_merged] 

SELECT DISTINCT( (LEN(Id))) 
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]
```
Length was found same across al the Id's (10)

#### 3.5 Cleaning data

3.5.1 Duplicates
```
SELECT 
  Id,
  ActivityDate,
  Count(*) 
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
GROUP BY
  Id, ActivityDate
Having count(*)>1
# No duplicates found
```
```
SELECT 
  Id,
  SleepDay,
  Count(*) 
FROM [dbo].[sleepDay_merged]
GROUP BY
  Id, SleepDay
Having count(*)>1
# No duplicates found
```
```
SELECT 
  Id,
  Date,
  Count(*) 
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]
GROUP BY
  Id, Date
Having count(*)>1
# No duplicates found
```
3.5.2 Checking Null data
```
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
WHERE Id IS NULL
```
```
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[dailyActivity_merged]
WHERE Id IS NULL
```
```
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[sleepDay_merged]
WHERE Id IS NULL	
```
```
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]
WHERE Id IS NULL
```
```
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[weightLogInfo_merged]
WHERE Fat IS NULL
# 65 found 
```
